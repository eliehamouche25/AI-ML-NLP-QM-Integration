Activity Diagram
An activity diagram visually presents a series of actions or flow of control in a system similar to a flowchart or a data flow diagram. 

Activity diagrams are often used in business process modeling. They can also describe the steps in a use case diagram. Activities modeled can be sequential and concurrent. In both cases an activity diagram will have a beginning (an initial state) and an end (a final state).
