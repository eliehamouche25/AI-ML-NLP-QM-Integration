Statechart Diagrams

A Statechart diagram describes a state machine. State machine can be defined as a machine which defines
different states of an object and these states are controlled by external or internal events.
As Statechart diagram defines the states, it is used to model the lifetime of an object.

Statechart diagram is one of the UML diagrams used to model the dynamic nature of a system. 
They define different states of an object during its lifetime and these states are changed by events. 
Statechart diagrams are useful to model the reactive systems. 
Reactive systems can be defined as a system that responds to external or internal events.

Statechart diagram describes the flow of control from one state to another state. 
States are defined as a condition in which an object exists and it changes when some event is triggered. 
The most important purpose of Statechart 
diagram is to model lifetime of an object from creation to termination.
Statechart diagrams are also used for forward and reverse engineering of a system.

Statechart diagrams are very important for describing the states.
States can be identified as the condition of objects when a particular event occurs.
we should clarify the following points âˆ’
Identify the important objects to be analyzed.
Identify the states.
Identify the events.

and Events are internal or external factors influencing the system.
Statechart diagrams are used to model the states and also the events operating on the system.
