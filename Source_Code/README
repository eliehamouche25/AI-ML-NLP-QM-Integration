Since its founding in 2007, Lincoln Loop has been building sites for their clients 
with Python and Django. They credit Python's philosophy of practicality and explicitness,
along with the rich ecosystem of open-source libraries available on PyPI, as keys to their success. 

Python is used in many application domains. Here's a sampling.

1.Web and Internet Development
Python's standard library supports many Internet protocols:
HTML and XML JSON
E-mail processing.
Support for FTP, IMAP, and other Internet protocols.
Easy-to-use socket interface.
And the Package Index has yet more libraries:
Requests, a powerful HTTP client library.
Beautiful Soup, an HTML parser that can handle all sorts of oddball HTML.

2.Scientific and Numeric
Python is widely used in scientific and numeric computing:
SciPy is a collection of packages for mathematics, science, and engineering.
Pandas is a data analysis and modeling library.
Matplotlib : A visualization library used to create static, animated, and interactive plots.  
Scikit-learn : The go-to library for classical machine learning. Includes tools for classification, regression, clustering, model selection, and preprocessing.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) : Used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks like tokenization, stemming, sentiment analysis, and language modeling.
Qiskit : Developed by IBM for quantum computing. Enables the design, simulation, and execution of quantum circuits. Used to explore hybrid quantumâ€“classical AI models.

3.Education
Python is a superb language for teaching programming, both at the introductory level and in more advanced courses.
Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science, and Practical Programming.

4.Software Development
Python is often used as a support language for software developers, for build control and management, 
testing, and in many other ways.

5.Business Applications
Python is also used to build ERP and e-commerce systems:
